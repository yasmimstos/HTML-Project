# About The Project
This project started its development on 5 July 2022, in order to be a kind of layout standard for future projects. In addition, it will also serve for me, developer of this project, to be able to see my evolution in programming with HTML / CSS. This project can, and should be used by anyone for any purpose that is of interest. It is worth noting that, I am learning, and any comment that serves to help me in my journey with programming will be useful. Please contact me by email: yasmimydso@gmail.com.
I appreciate your attention so far.
